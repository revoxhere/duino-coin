<h3>
  Duino-Coin is a coin that can be mined with Arduinos, ESP8266/32 boards, Raspberry Pis, computers, and many more 
  (including Wi-Fi routers, smart TVs, smartphones, smartwatches, SBCs, MCUs or even GPUs)
</h3>

| 💻 Supported by a large number of platforms<br>👥 A fast-growing community<br>💱 Easy to use & exchange<br>(on DUCO Exchange, Node-S, JustSwap, SushiSwap)<br>🌎 Available everywhere<br>:new: Fully original & open-source project<br>🌳 Beginner & eco-friendly<br>💰 Cost-effective & easy to mine | ⚒️ Algorithm: DUCO-S1<br>♐ Rewards: supported by "Kolka system"<br>helping to reward miners fairly<br>⚡ Transaction time: Instant<br>🪙 Coin supply: Infinite<br>(before December 2020: 350k coins)<br>(new limits planned for the future)<br>🔤 Ticker: DUCO (ᕲ)<br>🔢 Decimals: up to 20 | ♾️ Arduinos<br>(Uno, Nano, Mega, Due, Pro Mini, etc.)<br>📶 ESP8266s<br>(NodeMCU, Wemos, etc.)<br>📶 ESP32s<br>(ESP-WROOM, ESP32-CAM, etc.)<br>🍓 Raspberry Pis<br>(1, 2, Zero (W/WH), 3, 4, Pico, 400)<br>🍊 Orange Pis<br>(Zero, Zero 2, PC, Plus, etc.)<br>⚡ Teensy 4.1 boards |


## Getting started

#### The easiest way to get started with Duino-Coin is to download [the latest release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/latest) for your OS.<br>
After downloading the release, unzip it and launch the desired program.<br>
There are no dependencies required.

If you need help, you can take a look at the official getting started guides located <a href="https://duinocoin.com/getting-started">on the official website</a>.<br>
FAQ and troubleshooting help can be found in the [Wikis](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/wiki).<br>


### Manual installation

#### Linux

```BASH
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk -y # Install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin # Clone Duino-Coin repository
cd duino-coin
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt # Install pip dependencies
````

After doing this, you are good to go with launching the software (e.g. `python3 PC_Miner.py`).


#### Windows

1. Download and install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (make sure you add Python and Pip to your PATH)
2. Download [the Duino-Coin repository](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/archive/master.zip)
3. Extract the zip archive you've downloaded and open the folder in command prompt
4. In command prompt type `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required pip dependencies

After doing this, you are good to go with launching the software (just double click on desired `.py` files or type `py PC_Miner.py` in the command prompt).

## DUCO & wDUCO

Duino-Coin is a hybrid currency, meaning that it can be converted to wDUCO which is DUCO wrapped on the [Tron](https://tron.network) network (as a token). Currently there aren't many uses for it, other than just storing funds in an external wallet or exchanging wDUCO to another token on JustSwap. A tutorial on using wDUCO is available in the [wDUCO wiki](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/wiki/wDUCO-tutorial).


## Development

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create.<br>
Any contributions you make to the Duino-Coin project are greatly appreciated.

How to help?

*   Fork the Project
*   Create your feature branch
*   Commit your changes
*   Make sure everything works as intended
*   Open a pull request

Server source code, documentation for API calls and official libraries for developing your own apps for Duino-Coin are available in the [useful tools](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/tree/useful-tools) branch.

Duino-Coin is mostly distributed under the MIT License. See the `LICENSE` file for more information.
Some third-party included files may have different licenses - please check their `LICENSE` statements (usually at the top of the source code files).


## Terms of service
1. Duino-Coins ("DUCOs") are earned by miners with a process called mining.<br/>
2. Mining is described as using DUCO-S1 algorithm (as explained in the <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/blob/gh-pages/assets/whitepaper.pdf">Duino-Coin Whitepaper</a>), in which finding a correct result to a mathematical problem gives the miner a reward.<br/>
3. Mining can be officially done using CPUs, AVR boards (e.g. Arduino boards), Single-board computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi boards), ESP32/8266 boards with the usage of official miners (other officially allowed miners are described in the upper part of README).<br/>
4. Mining on GPUs, FPGAs and other high-efficiency hardware is allowed, but using only the `EXTREME` mining difficulty.<br/>
5. Any users using miners on difficulty not suited for their hardware (see the <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/tree/useful-tools#socket-api">difficulty list</a>) will be automatically throttled by being moved to correct difficulty tier.<br/>
6. Any user that keeps trying to use lower difficulty than it's suited for may get temporarily blocked.<br/>
7. Banning involves blocking the user from accessing his coins along with the removal of an account.<br/>
8. Only coins earned legally are eligible for the exchange.<br/>
9. Accounts may be suspended temporarily to investigate ("investigations") ToS violations ("violation" or "abuse").<br/>
10. An exchange request made to the offical DUCO-Exchange ("the offical exchange") may be delayed and/or declined during investigations. <br/>
11. Exchange requests made to the offical exchange may be declined due to ToS violations and/or low funding.<br/>
12. Mining with free cloud hosting services (or free VPS services - e.g. Repl.it, GitHub Actions, etc.) is not allowed as it's unfair for others.<br />
13. A user's DUCOs may be burnt if a violation can be proven.<br/>
14. These terms of service can change at any time without prior notice.<br/>
15. Having alt accounts without a rational reason (e.g. for multi-mining) are not allowed.<br/>
16. Every user using Duino-Coin agrees to comply with the above rules.<br/>


## Privacy policy
1. On the master server we only store usernames, hashed passwords (with the help of bcrypt), account creation dates and e-mails of users as their data.<br/>
2. E-mails are not publicly available and are only used for contacting user when needed, confirming exchanges on the <a href="https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-exchange/">DUCO-Exchange</a> and receiving an occasional newsletter (planned for the future).<br/>
3. Balances, transactions and mining-related data is publicly available in the public <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/tree/useful-tools#http-json-api">JSON APIs</a>.<br/>
4. The privacy policy may be changed in the future with a prior notification.
